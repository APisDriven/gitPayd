## Description

An application that allows users to keep track of buisness and personal transactions. By creating and sharing receipts to customers. Users are also given the ability to track all receipts each time a new receipt is created. 

This application is built using React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, and MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database. The application uses queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. It is deployed using Heroku and has a polished UI, is responsive, and interactive, which means that it accepts and responds to user input.
